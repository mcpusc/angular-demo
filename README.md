# angular-demo
Angular is a heavyweight framework for building interactive web applications. IMHO
it is not a general purpose language and should only be used where application load
is rare and complex interactive controls are desired. In this demo I intend to show
some powerful abstractions available in Angular and create a small elegant application
that demonstrates the possibilities.

The application is in typescript and angular 1.x, tests with karma/jasmine.
